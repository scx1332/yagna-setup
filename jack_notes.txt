Ready tools are designed to support developers in building Golem network components. This instruction will direct you on how to build components and create a test environment consisting of a single requestor and a single provider.
Such a set may communicate using a local central server bus, a public central bus, or a public relay.

Major steps:

Preparation
Install tools 
Cloning Golem repos
Building components
Setting the test environment

1. Preparation:
Clone this repo. Scripts were tested on Ubuntu.
```
git clone scx1332/yagna-setup.git
```

sudo adduser $USER kvm

Reboot.

2. Install software:

curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
sudo apt-get install musl
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install musl-tools
sudo apt-get install autoconf
sudo apt-get install libtool
sudo apt-get install gperf
sudo apt autoremove

3. Cloning of repos

Run the `prepare.sh` script.

4. Building components.

build_all.sh
This script builds all components for repos cloned in this directory.
Binaries are copied into the ./binaries directory.

Testing builds:

ya-provider exe-unit list

Should produce:
[2024-07-09T12:55:41.238+0200 INFO  ya_provider::execution::registry] Added [vm] ExeUnit to registry. Supervisor path: [/repo-path/yagna-setup/golem/binaries/plugins/exe-unit], Runtime path: [Some("/repo-path/yagna-setup/golem/binaries/plugins/ya-runtime-vm/ya-runtime-vm")].

Available ExeUnits:

Name:          vm
Version:       0.3.0
Supervisor:    /home/ubuntu/scx1332/yagna-setup/golem/binaries/plugins/exe-unit
Runtime:       /home/ubuntu/scx1332/yagna-setup/golem/binaries/plugins/ya-runtime-vm/ya-runtime-vm
Description:   vm runtime


Testing builds:
yagna --version
should produce
yagna 0.16.0+nightly (c2d09bb0 2024-07-09)


5 Setting the test environment.

The environment will consist of a single provider and a single requestor.
The concept is based the on:
Golem tools use the .env file in the `pwd` folder to read the configuration.
The `binaries` directory is before other Yagna locations in the PATH. 
The requestor will use default ports so you can use SDKs without additional setup.
Provider will use custom ports to avoid conflicts with the requestor.
The environment will use a central router (by default - which can be changed). 

-> You need to have the PATH configured
-> You need to run yagnas and golemsp and ya-provider from the provider and requestor folders.


Note: If you installed Yagna on this system using a standard installer before, you have the following components installed and in your PATH:
gftp, yagna, ya-provider, golemsp. 

By default, they are "installed" in /usr/bin. (They are in the ya-installer directory, in /usr/bin there are links).
Please remove them or change the order in the PATH variable so the ./binaries folder is before /usr/bin.

You can find them using the where command and remove them using 
rm -fr /path/to/the /file.

Add the `binaries` to the PATH. To avoid manually configuring the path in each terminal window add in .bashrc:
PATH=$PATH:/path/to/binaries

After the next login, you should be able to run yagna components located in ./binaries.

Note: exe-unit and ya-runtime-vm are not in the path. Other components find them in respective data folders. These folders can be configured indirectly by .env.

Build provider and requestor folders:

prepare_runtime.sh

- creates folders for the requestor and provider inside the ./golem directory.
`env.` files contain values for config parameters.
You can modify the script to create more provider folders for additional providers. Note you need to update the provider .env files.

The sequence of starting elements of the environment:

Start router: 
If you use a central router setup (default setup in provided .env) you need to start it first to enable communication between other elements.

ya-sb-router -l tcp://0.0.0.0:5555

Starting the provider:
cd to the provider's folder

yagna service run
[show logs: version]

yagna id list
[run this in the provider folder and outside to recall that config is taken from the .env file]

Run:
 golemsp setup
 to configure the provider. This will produce 2 JSON files with config: pricing and runtimes in a ya-provider folder in the `providerdir` (presets.json, globals.json).

[Account null  = means we had not provided a wallet, and income will come to the default wallet linked to nodeID.]

Note: for older yagna, before running ya-provider you need to initialize the payment driver:

yagna init --as-receiver --network holesky

Run:
ya-provider run

[show the content of yagna datadir and providerdir: sqlite dbs, logs]



Starting the requestor:
cd to requestor's folder:

Note: while we can run yagna commands as a requestor from any location (./binaries folder is in the PATH), however when you start it, you want to run with full config, so you need to start it in the requestor's folder.

6. Running examples.

Follow instructions from Quickstart to run examples in Python.

For js:
Install node (hint nvm will let you switch node version: nvm install --lts)
CD to the example folder
install libraries:
npm install
`node index.mjs` 
to run the examples

7. Other

Utilities:
cleanup.sh
 - removes the content of binaries, provider, and requestor folder

8.  `.env` variables

YAGNA_AUTOCONF_ID_SECRET=<takes private key to use by node>

YAGNA_API_ALLOW_ORIGIN=* - set CORS for any domain

configures the type of communication: central or hybrid
YA_NET_TYPE=central

If central: and you want to use a local central router:
CENTRAL_NET_HOST=127.0.0.1:5555

if hybrid and you want to use a local hybrid relay (must be running) 
# used when YA_NET_TYPE=hybrid
#YA_NET_BIND_URL=udp://0.0.0.0:11701

(note all nodes must have the same network type configured to work in the same net)

Debugging:
#RUST_LOG=info,ya_relay_client=error,actix_web::middleware=warn,ya_net=error,rustls=error,ya_sb_router=error
